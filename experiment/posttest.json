      "question": "1. With reference to TRIAC which of the following statement is WRONG?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "TRIAC conducts in only one direction.",
        "b": "TRIAC gives four quadrant operations.",
        "c": "TRIAC is a bidirectional device.",
        "d": "TRIAC can be triggered with positive as well as a negative gate signals."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Option A is correct because it is the wrong statement among all. A TRIAC is a bidirectional device, meaning it conducts current in both directions during alternate half cycles of AC. Saying it conducts in only one direction is false. Hence, option A is incorrect and is the right answer to the question asked.",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 2",
        "d": "Explanation 2"

        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 2",
        "d": "A TRIAC (Triode for Alternating Current) is a bidirectional switch, which means it can conduct current in both directions when triggered. It is widely used for controlling AC power."
